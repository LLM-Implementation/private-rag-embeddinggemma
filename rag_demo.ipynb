      "Let me analyze the provided contexts to answer the question about how to use SQLite-vec with Python.\n",
      "\n",
      "The contexts include documentation for sqlite-vec, specifically the Python section. Here's what I can extract:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Installation: The documentation says to install the sqlite-vec PyPi package using pip:\n",
      "   ```bash\n",
      "   pip install sqlite-vec\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Loading the extension: After installation, use the `sqlite_vec.load()` function to load sqlite-vec SQL functions into a SQLite connection:\n",
      "   ```python\n",
      "   import sqlite3\n",
      "   import sqlite_vec\n",
      "\n",
      "   db = sqlite3.connect(\":memory:\")\n",

      "   db.enable_load_extension(False)\n",
      "   ```\n",

      "3. Checking the version: After loading, you can check the version with:\n",
      "   ```python\n",
      "   vec_version, = db.execute(\"select vec_version()\").fetchone()\n",
      "   print(f\"vec_version={vec_version}\")\n",
      "   ```\n",

      "4. Working with vectors:\n",
      "   - For lists of floats: Use `serialize_float32()` to convert to the compact BLOB format\n",
      "   - For NumPy arrays: Can be passed directly as-is (after casting to 32-bit floats)\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Using an up-to-date SQLite: The documentation mentions that some features require SQLite 3.41 or higher.\n",

      "# How Vector Similarity Search Works\n",
      "\n",
      "Vector similarity search is a fundamental technique in modern information retrieval and natural language processing that finds relevant documents or results based on semantic similarity rather than exact keyword matching. Here's how it works:\n",
      "\n",
      "## Basic Workflow\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Text to Vector Conversion**: \n",
      "   - Input text (queries or documents) is converted into dense numerical vectors using an embedding model\n",
      "   - In your case, models like EmbeddingGemma (Google's efficient multilingual embedding model) create these vectors\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Similarity Calculation**:\n",
      "   - For a query vector, calculate similarity with all document vectors\n",
      "   - Most common metric: Cosine similarity (measures angle between vectors)\n",
      "   - Other metrics: Euclidean distance, dot product\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Ranking and Retrieval**:\n",
      "   - Results are ranked by similarity score\n",
      "   - Top N most similar documents are returned as the answer\n",
      "\n",
      "## In Practice with EmbeddingGemma\n",
      "\n",
      "As shown in your examples, when using EmbeddingGemma with frameworks like Sentence Transformers:\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer\n",
      "\n",
      "# Load EmbeddingGemma model\n",
      "model = SentenceTransformer(\"google/embeddinggemma-300m\")\n",
      "\n",
      "# Convert query and documents to embeddings\n",
      "query_embedding = model.encode(\"Which planet is known as the Red Planet?\")\n",
      "document_embeddings = model.encode([\n",
      "    \"Venus is often called Earth's twin because of its similar size and proximity.\",\n",
      "    \"Mars, known for its reddish appearance, is often referred to as the Red Planet.\",\n",
      "    \"Jupiter, the largest planet in our solar system, has a prominent red spot.\",\n",
      "    \"Saturn, famous for its rings, is sometimes mistaken for the Red Planet.\"\n",
      "])\n",
      "\n",
      "# Calculate similarity and find top results\n",
      "from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity\n",
      "\n",
      "# Calculate cosine similarity matrix\n",
      "similarity_matrix = cosine_similarity([query_embedding], [document_embeddings])[0]\n",
      "\n",
      "# Get top matching documents\n",
      "top_indices = np.argsort(similarity_matrix)[0][::-1][:3]\n",
      "top_results = [documents[i] for i in top_indices]\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "## Why This Matters\n",
      "\n",
      "Vector similarity search is powerful because:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. It understands semantic meaning rather than just keywords\n",
      "2. It works well with large datasets (millions of documents)\n",
      "3. It enables applications like:\n",
      "   - Semantic search\n",
      "   - Recommendation systems\n",
      "   - Chatbots with contextual understanding\n",
      "   - Document similarity detection\n",
      "\n",
      "The EmbeddingGemma model you mentioned has particular advantages for this task:\n",
      "- 308M parameters (small but powerful)\n",
      "- 2K context window (good for longer queries)\n",
      "- Supports over 100 languages\n",
      "- Truncatable output (768-dimensional vectors can be reduced to 512, 256, or 128 dimensions)\n",
      "\n",
      "In frameworks like Haystack and txtai, this process is implemented with optimized search algorithms (like ANN - Approximate Nearest Neighbors) to handle large-scale vector similarity search efficiently.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is why your example shows how EmbeddingGemma can find \"Mars, known for its reddish appearance, is often referred to as the Red Planet\" as the most relevant result for the query \"Which planet is known as the Red Planet?\"\n",

    "## 🎉 Congratulations!\n",
    "\n",
    "You've successfully built a complete private RAG system! Here's what we accomplished:\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ What We Built:\n",
    "- **Document Scraping**: Automated collection from web sources\n",
    "- **Smart Chunking**: Optimized text segmentation for better retrieval\n",
    "- **Modern Embeddings**: Google's EmbeddingGemma with Matryoshka learning\n",
    "- **Vector Database**: SQLite-vec for fast similarity search\n",
    "- **Local LLM**: Qwen3 for generating contextual responses\n",
    "- **Complete Privacy**: Everything runs locally, no API calls\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🚀 Key Benefits:\n",
    "- **100% Private**: All processing happens on your machine\n",
    "- **Zero Cost**: No API fees or usage limits\n",
    "- **Offline Capable**: Works without internet after initial setup\n",
    "- **Efficient**: EmbeddingGemma + SQLite-vec = fast performance\n",
    "- **Scalable**: Can handle thousands of documents\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔄 Next Steps:\n",
    "- Add more document sources to expand knowledge base\n",
    "- Experiment with different chunking strategies\n",
    "- Try other embedding dimensions (128, 512, 768)\n",
    "- Implement conversation memory for multi-turn chats\n",
    "- Build a simple web interface with Streamlit or Gradio\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📚 Resources:\n",
    "- [EmbeddingGemma Documentation](https://huggingface.co/google/embeddinggemma-300m)\n",
    "- [SQLite-vec GitHub](https://github.com/asg017/sqlite-vec)\n",
    "- [Ollama Models](https://ollama.com/library)\n",
